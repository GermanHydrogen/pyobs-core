Overview
========

After installing pyobs, you have the new command ``pyobs``, which creates and
starts pyobs modules from the command line based on a configuration file, written
in YAML.

A simple configuration file (``standalone.yaml``) might look like this::

    class: pyobs.modules.test.StandAlone
    message: Hello world
    interval: 10

Basically you always define a ``class`` for a block together with its properties.

In this example, the module is of type :class:`~pyobs.modules.test.StandAlone`, which is a trivial implementation
of a module that does nothing more than logging a given message continuously in a given interval::

    class StandAlone(Module):
        """Example module that only logs the given message forever in the given interval."""

        def __init__(self, message: str = 'Hello world', interval: int = 10, *args, **kwargs):
            """Creates a new StandAlone object.

            Args:
                message: Message to log in the given interval.
                interval: Interval between messages.
            """
            Module.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

            # add thread func
            self._add_thread_func(self._message_func, True)

            # store
            self._message = message
            self._interval = interval

        def _message_func(self):
            """Thread function for async processing."""
            # loop until closing
            while not self.closing.is_set():
                # log message
                log.info(self._message)

                # sleep a little
                self.closing.wait(self._interval)

The constructor just calls the constructor of :class:`~pyobs.modules.Module` and calls a method
:meth:`~pyobs.object.Object.add_thread_func`, which takes a method that is run in an extra thread. In this case,
it is the method ``thread_func()``, that does some logging in a loop until the program quits.

The class method default_config() defines the default configuration for the module, and open() and close()
are called when the module is opened and closed, respectively.

If the configuration file is saved as ``standalone.yaml``, one can easily start it via the ``pyobs`` command::

    pyobs standalone.yaml

The program quits gracefully when it receives an interrupt, so you can stop it by simply pressing ``Ctrl+c``.


Modules
-------

A Module defines a single process in *pyobs*, as defined in :class:`~pyobs.modules.Module`. Modules can work
completely independent of each other, but usually they want to communicate and call methods on other modules.
The functionality that a module exports for remote calling is defined by its base classe, specifically classes
derived from :class:`~pyobs.interfaces.Interface`.


Location of observatory
-----------------------

There is some functionality that is required in many modules, including those concerning the environment,
especially the location of the telescope and the local time. For this, the :class:`~pyobs.application.Application` class
has support for an additional module of type :class:`~pyobs.environment.Environment`, which can be
defined in the application's configuration at top-level like this::

    timezone: Africa/Johannesburg
    location:
      longitude: 20.810808
      latitude: -32.375823
      elevation: 1798.

Now an object of this type is automatically pushed into the module and can be accessed via the ``environment``
property, e.g.::

    def open(self):
        Module.open(self)
        print(self.environment.location)


Communication between modules
-----------------------------

In case the module is supposed to communicate with others, we need another module of type
:class:`~pyobs.comm.Comm`, which can be defined in the application's configuration like this::

    comm:
      class: pyobs.comm.xmpp.XmppComm
      jid: some_module@my.domain.com

More details about this can be found in the :doc:`api/comm` section.


Virtual File System
-------------------

At the telescope the *pyobs* system usually contains multiple modules that are distributed over several computers. In
order to make file exchange es easy as possible, *pyobs* has a built-in virtual file system (VFS) that dynamically maps
file paths to real locations.

A typical VFS setup in a module configuration file looks like this::

    vfs:
      class: pyobs.vfs.VirtualFileSystem
      roots:
        cache:
          class: pyobs.vfs.LocalFile
          root: /path/to/data

This simple case uses a :class:`~pyobs.vfs.LocalFile` to map every filename beginning with ``cache`` (see the key in the
``roots`` dictionary) to the path ``/path/to/data`` in the local file system. So opening a file via
``vfs.open_file('/cache/test.txt', 'w')`` actually opens the file in ``/path/to/data/test.txt`` for writing.

The magic begins when running another module on another computer with this configuration::

    vfs:
      class: pyobs.vfs.VirtualFileSystem
      roots:
        cache:
          class: pyobs.vfs.SSHFile
          hostname: othercomputer
          username: xxx
          password: xxx
          root: /path/to/data

Now on that machine you can read the same file, using the same command ``vfs.open_file('/cache/test.txt', 'r')``,
via a SSH connection, by specifying :class:`~pyobs.vfs.SSHFile` as the class for the given root.

See :doc:`api/vfs` for more information about the VFS.


Events
------

In addition to calling each other's method, *pyobs* modules can also send and receive events. See more about this
in :doc:`api/events`.
