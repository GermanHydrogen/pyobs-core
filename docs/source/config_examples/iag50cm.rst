Configuration of the IAG 50cm
-----------------------------

This is the configuration for the 50cm telescope at the Institute for Astrophysics and Geophysics in GÃ¶ttingen. See
`here <https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/217812.html>`_ for more details.

The modules are distributed over two different computers, ``iag50srv`` and ``iag50cam``. Autoslew is used as the
telescope software and is running on a third computer, together with an
`ASCOM Alpaca Remote server <https://www.ascom-standards.org/Developer/Alpaca.htm>`_ for remote access.

All the configs are shown here without the ``comm`` part and the environment details.

* The :class:`~pyobs.modules.pointing.Acquisition` class is used for the acquisition module (line 1).
* It requires the name of the other modules to use, which are :ref:`telescope` for the telescope, :ref:`sbig6303e`
  for the camera and the same for module for the filter wheel, since it is integrated into the camera (lines 4-6).
* The camera settings for the acquisition images (lines 9-11).
* A log file where all the offsets from the acquisitions are stored, can be useful for checking the pointing model
  (line 14).
* Tolerances for the acquisiton: it succeeds if the telescope is closer than 10" to the target and fails if the offsets
  get larger than 7200".
* The pipeline defines steps performed on the images in order to get the offsets for the next step (lines 20-25):

  #. :class:`~pyobs.images.processors.detection.SepSourceDetection` detects sources in the image.
  #. :class:`~pyobs.images.processors.astrometry.AstrometryDotNet` performs the astrometric calibration using a local
     astrometry.net server.
  #. :class:`~pyobs.images.processors.offsets.AstrometryOffsets` uses the astronomy to calculate offsets for the next
     telescope move.

* The offsets are applied via :class:`~pyobs.utils.offsets.ApplyRaDecOffsets`. It fails if the total offset gets larger
  than 7200" (lines 27-29).
* Finally, a VFS is defined with a root ``cache`` that points to the :ref:`filecache` HTTP cache server (lines 31-36).

* The :class:`~pyobs.modules.focus.AutoFocusSeries` class is used for the auto focus module (line 1).
* It requires the name of the other modules to use, which are :ref:`focuser` for the focus unit, :ref:`sbig6303e`
  for the camera and the same for module for the filter wheel, since it is integrated into the camera (lines 4-6).
* The ``offset`` parameter defines, whether absolute focus values are used or offsets from a fixed value (line 9).
* Image settings (lines 12-13).
* The actual focus series is done using the helper class :class:`~pyobs.utils.focusseries.ProjectionFocusSeries`
  (lines 16-17).
* Finally, a VFS is defined with a root ``cache`` that points to the :ref:`filecache` HTTP cache server (lines 31-36).
